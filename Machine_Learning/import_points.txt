--------------------------------
Small learning rate often leads to a overfitting so there is policy called a cyclic learning rate and
we can use that policy where learning rate vary in between the range .



---------------------------------
min learning rate can be one tenth of the maximum it is like rule of thumb




----------------------------------
small batch sizes added the regularization where as larger batch sizes are not so keep in mind this 
thing and also batch size can be maximum of your computer memory so remember while assigning a batch size
