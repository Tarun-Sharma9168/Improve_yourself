      "\n",
      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "In 1999, we made  significant  strides to transform AT&T and deliver growth.  We\n",
      "finalized  many of the  strategic  acquisitions  we  announced  in 1998 and made\n",
      "additional investments to further support our facilities-based  growth strategy.\n",
      "We continued to maintain the execution-focused culture of the new AT&T.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most  dynamic  areas in 1999 was our  wireless  business.  Increasing\n",
      "demand for wireless  services and the  continued  appeal of our Digital One Rate\n",
      "(sm) plans drove Wireless  Services  revenue to grow  approximately  40% for the\n",
      "year.  Throughout  1999 we continued to expand our  national  footprint.  In the\n",
      "second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Vanguard Cellular Systems, which\n",
      "was announced in 1998; in August we closed the acquisition of Honolulu Cellular;\n",
      "and in October we announced the acquisition of American Cellular Corp. through a\n",
      "newly created joint venture  between AT&T and Dobson  Communications.  We capped\n",
      "off the year by  proposing  the  creation of a new class of tracking  stock that\n",
      "will reflect the economic  performance  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group.  While the\n",
      "Wireless  Group will  remain  part of AT&T,  the  separate  tracking  stock will\n",
      "provide current  shareowners and future  investors with a security tied directly\n",
      "to the performance of this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we worked to grow our wireless  businesses in 1999,  we also started  putting\n",
      "the bricks  and  mortar  around our  broadband  plans - a key  component  of our\n",
      "overall   growth   strategy.   We   completed   our  $52  billion   merger  with\n",
      "Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) in March, and quickly accelerated the upgrade of\n",
      "the TCI cable plant,  which will enable us to develop additional revenue streams\n",
      "from  any-distance  cable telephony,  high-speed data, and digital video. By the\n",
      "end of 1999,  TCI,  renamed AT&T  Broadband,  was offering cable telephony in 16\n",
      "cities   within   nine  pilot   markets,   digital-video   subscribers   totaled\n",
      "approximately  1.8 million,  and more than 200,000  customers  had signed up for\n",
      "high-speed  data  service.  To expand our  national  cable  network  beyond AT&T\n",
      "Broadband's  systems,  we announced in May the $57 billion merger with MediaOne.\n",
      "When the  merger  is  completed  in 2000,  we will  significantly  increase  our\n",
      "presence  in major  metropolitan  markets  across  the  country  with  owned and\n",
      "operated cable systems passing more than 26 million homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the accomplishments in our domestic growth  initiatives,  we also\n",

      "international  carriers and Internet service  providers in January 2000. As part\n",
      "of our  relationship  with  Concert  and BT,  we also  made  several  in-country\n",
      "facility-based  investments  during 1999,  including  AT&T Canada Corp.,  Rogers\n",
      "Cantel in Canada,  and Japan  Telecom.  We also  completed  the  purchase of IBM\n",

      "\n",
      "In 1999, we made  significant  strides to transform AT&T and deliver growth.  We\n",
      "finalized  many of the  strategic  acquisitions  we  announced  in 1998 and made\n",
      "additional investments to further support our facilities-based  growth strategy.\n",
      "We continued to maintain the execution-focused culture of the new AT&T.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most  dynamic  areas in 1999 was our  wireless  business.  Increasing\n",
      "demand for wireless  services and the  continued  appeal of our Digital One Rate\n",
      "(sm) plans drove Wireless  Services  revenue to grow  approximately  40% for the\n",
      "year.  Throughout  1999 we continued to expand our  national  footprint.  In the\n",
      "second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Vanguard Cellular Systems, which\n",
      "was announced in 1998; in August we closed the acquisition of Honolulu Cellular;\n",
      "and in October we announced the acquisition of American Cellular Corp. through a\n",
      "newly created joint venture  between AT&T and Dobson  Communications.  We capped\n",
      "off the year by  proposing  the  creation of a new class of tracking  stock that\n",
      "will reflect the economic  performance  of the AT&T  Wireless  Group.  While the\n",
      "Wireless  Group will  remain  part of AT&T,  the  separate  tracking  stock will\n",
      "provide current  shareowners and future  investors with a security tied directly\n",
      "to the performance of this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we worked to grow our wireless  businesses in 1999,  we also started  putting\n",
      "the bricks  and  mortar  around our  broadband  plans - a key  component  of our\n",
      "overall   growth   strategy.   We   completed   our  $52  billion   merger  with\n",
      "Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) in March, and quickly accelerated the upgrade of\n",
      "the TCI cable plant,  which will enable us to develop additional revenue streams\n",
      "from  any-distance  cable telephony,  high-speed data, and digital video. By the\n",
      "end of 1999,  TCI,  renamed AT&T  Broadband,  was offering cable telephony in 16\n",
      "cities   within   nine  pilot   markets,   digital-video   subscribers   totaled\n",
      "approximately  1.8 million,  and more than 200,000  customers  had signed up for\n",
      "high-speed  data  service.  To expand our  national  cable  network  beyond AT&T\n",
      "Broadband's  systems,  we announced in May the $57 billion merger with MediaOne.\n",
      "When the  merger  is  completed  in 2000,  we will  significantly  increase  our\n",
      "presence  in major  metropolitan  markets  across  the  country  with  owned and\n",
      "operated cable systems passing more than 26 million homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the accomplishments in our domestic growth  initiatives,  we also\n",
      "made  significant  progress in our global  strategy.  Most notably,  we launched\n",
      "Concert - a leading global  telecommunications  company  created  through AT&T's\n",
      "joint venture with British  Telecommunications  plc (BT). Concert represents the\n",
      "core of our global strategy and began serving multinational  business customers,\n",
      "international  carriers and Internet service  providers in January 2000. As part\n",
      "of our  relationship  with  Concert  and BT,  we also  made  several  in-country\n",
      "facility-based  investments  during 1999,  including  AT&T Canada Corp.,  Rogers\n",
      "Cantel in Canada,  and Japan  Telecom.  We also  completed  the  purchase of IBM\n",
